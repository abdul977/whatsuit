# Current Implementation vs Proposed Changes

## Current Implementation

### 1. App Display Logic
- Header shows all apps as filter chips
- Main content shows notifications grouped by conversation/number first
- No hierarchical grouping by app

### 2. Grouping Logic (GroupedNotificationAdapter.java)
```java
WhatsApp:
- Extracts phone number from notification title only
- Requires exactly 11 digits to create phone number group
- Falls back to first 5 characters of title if not 11 digits

Other Apps:
- Groups by first 5 characters of notification title
```

### 3. Database Queries (NotificationDao.java)
```sql
- Groups notifications using LEFT JOIN based on:
  - Same package name AND
  - Either:
    - WhatsApp: Matches first 11 digits of cleaned phone number
    - Other apps: Matches first 5 characters of title
  - Within 24 hours timeframe
```

## Problems with Current Approach

1. App Grouping Issues:
- No primary grouping by app despite header showing apps
- Requires manual filtering using chips
- Inconsistent user experience

2. WhatsApp Number Issues:
- Only checks title for numbers, ignoring content
- Strict 11-digit requirement causes incorrect grouping
- Title prefix fallback mixes different conversations

## Proposed New Implementation

### 1. New App Display Logic
```
Level 1: Group by Application
â”œâ”€â”€ App section with collapsible header
â”œâ”€â”€ App icon and name
â””â”€â”€ Total notification count

Level 2: Within Each App Section
â”œâ”€â”€ Group by conversation/contact
â”œâ”€â”€ WhatsApp: Group by phone number (from title/content)
â””â”€â”€ Other apps: Group by conversation title
```

### 2. New Grouping Logic
```java
// Step 1: Primary App Grouping
- Group all notifications by packageName
- Create app section headers with counts

// Step 2: Secondary Conversation Grouping
WhatsApp:
- Extract numbers from title and content
- Use flexible number matching
- Handle international formats
- Fall back to full title if no number

Other Apps:
- Group by full conversation title
- Implement smarter title matching
```

### 3. New Database Query Structure
```sql
WITH AppGroups AS (
  -- First level: Group by app
  SELECT packageName, appName, COUNT(*) as app_count
  FROM notifications
  GROUP BY packageName
),
ConversationGroups AS (
  -- Second level: Group by conversation
  SELECT n.*,
    CASE 
      WHEN packageName LIKE '%whatsapp%'
      THEN extract_phone_number(title, content)
      ELSE title
    END as conversation_id
  FROM notifications n
)
SELECT * FROM ConversationGroups
ORDER BY packageName, conversation_id, timestamp DESC
```

## Expected Outcome

### Visual Structure
```
ðŸ“± WhatsApp (15)
  â””â”€ +234 123 456 7890 (5 messages)
  â””â”€ +234 098 765 4321 (10 messages)

ðŸ“± Instagram (8)
  â””â”€ John Doe (3 messages)
  â””â”€ Jane Smith (5 messages)

ðŸ“± Facebook (12)
  â””â”€ Messenger Group 1 (7 messages)
  â””â”€ Messenger Chat 2 (5 messages)
```
